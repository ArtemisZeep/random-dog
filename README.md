Project: Random-Dog

This application allows to get a random breed of dog, its photos, country of origin, height, weight, a link to Wikipedia and a description of the breed.

Technologies used here:
HTML5
CSS3
JavaScript
React
JSX
Webpack
NPM
API - Wikimedia API, Bing Search API and Dogs Breed API

What needs to be finalized:
First of all, I need to speed up the application, possibly replacing the Bing Search API, which finds photos in the Bing  and thereby uploads photos to the application. Since the photos have the original size, it is needed to work out the compression of the photos. Also, in the future, I can create a loading screen during rendering pages, in order to improve the user's interaction with the application.
